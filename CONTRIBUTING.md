## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
- Use the GitHub issue tracker
- Check if the bug has already been reported
- Provide detailed information about the bug
- Include steps to reproduce the issue

### Suggesting Enhancements
- Use the GitHub issue tracker with the "enhancement" label
- Provide a clear description of the enhancement
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful

### Contributing Code
- Fork the repository
- Create a feature branch
- Make your changes
- Submit a pull request

### Improving Documentation
- Fix typos, clarify language, or add missing information
- Documentation changes follow the same process as code changes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker (version 20.10 or higher)
- Git
- Basic knowledge of ZeroTier networking
- Access to ZeroTier networks for testing (recommended)

### Development Environment Setup

### Local Development Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lferrarotti74/LibHdHomerun-Docker.git
   cd LibHdHomerun-Docker
   ```
3. Build the Docker image locally:
   ```bash
   docker build -t libhdhomerun-docker:dev .
   ```
4. Create a branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Testing Your Changes

1. **Build and test the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t libhdhomerun-docker:test .
   ```

2. **Test basic functionality:**
   ```bash
   # Test discovery (requires HDHomeRun on network)
   docker run --rm --network host libhdhomerun-docker:test /libhdhomerun/hdhomerun_config discover
   
   # Test help command
   docker run --rm libhdhomerun-docker:test /libhdhomerun/hdhomerun_config
   ```

3. **Test with your HDHomeRun device (if available):**
   ```bash
   # Replace with your device IP
   docker run --rm --network host libhdhomerun-docker:test /libhdhomerun/hdhomerun_config 192.168.1.100 get /sys/version
   ```

Make sure all tests pass before submitting your changes.

## Development Guidelines

### Docker and Infrastructure Standards
- Follow Docker best practices (multi-stage builds, minimal layers, etc.)
- Use official base images when possible
- Minimize image size while maintaining functionality
- Document any changes to the Dockerfile with comments
- Test on multiple architectures if possible (amd64, arm64)

### Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
Add user authentication feature

- Implement login/logout functionality
- Add password hashing
- Create user session management
- Fixes #123
```

### Branch Naming
- Use descriptive names: `feature/multi-arch-support`, `bugfix/discovery-timeout`, `docs/usage-examples`
- Use lowercase and hyphens

## Submitting Changes
